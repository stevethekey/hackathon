Broward College Hackathon, 2019.
  A transfer guide to assist students for Broward College students 
  in determining the prerequisites for their intended major at their intended university.

  The program asks the user for their name, intended major, and intended university. Then, the program redirects them to the page
  they need to be to determine the right prerequisites. From there, they may be able to make an appointment with an advisor. 
  
  This was the first time I used HTML. I learned a lot from the mentors, as it even features a little bit of javascript with the user         interaction. Most importantly, I'm proud of this because I think this program is useful and can help students with the process of        transferring colleges.
