How do I run this?
    No makefile here to make an executable file haha. To run this, you just need:

    1) be on VS code

    2) have VS code extension called "open in browser" installed

    3) right click the HTML document called index.html, then click "Open in other browser". Finally, select Google Chrome. 

    Also, the documents must exist in your local machine. The complier needs a way to access the path to these files, meaning index/style 
    files must be somewhere in your computer preferably together in a folder.
